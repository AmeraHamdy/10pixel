		<h1 style="background-color:#DEB887 ;">Health Food</h1>
		<p>Healthy foods assist a person in enhancing the physical and mental well-being. These foods are full of nourishment and enhance growth. Some of the significant examples of healthy food involve natural food, fiber-rich food, vitamin-rich food, protein-rich food, etc.
		Healthy food keeps us away from diseases. We feel relaxed, light and stress-free when we eat nourishing food because we know we are feeding something healthy and good to our bodies.

						<h4 style="color:brown;">Food Steaming</h3>
						<p>If you own a countertop steamer you can do a LOT with it.
						For example, you can steam veggies. You can cook grains like brown rice and organic corn on the cob. 
						You can also make lentils and other small legumes in a steamer. Everything turns out perfectly cooked.
						it like Vegetables, Whole Grains, Lentils/Small Legumes, Tempeh.

						<h4  style="color:brown;">Sautéing</h3>
						<p>Vegetables actually cook a little faster sautéed with a lid on the pan than in a steamer.
						But the only drawback is that it's a little more hands-on than a steamer because you should stir 
						it at least once halfway through the cooking process. In addition, 
						you might have to add a little more broth to ensure the pan doesn't get too dry.

						<h4  style="color:brown;">Pressure Cooking</h3>
						<p>cooking looked so scary and confusing, and if this sounds like you than let me reassure you that 
						it is easier than you think. The instructions are really straight-forward too. 
						And it's one of those techniques that you don't have to sit and watch so it's less hands-on.</p>

						<h4  style="color:brown;">Boiling</h3>
						<p>You might think that a pot is best for boiling, but not always.
						I much prefer to make quinoa, buckwheat, and millet in a large pan with a lid instead.
						They are fairly quick-cooking grains, and the wide pan makes it all cook even faster -
						- ESPECIALLY if they've been pre-soaked (we're talking instead of 12-15 minutes they cook up in 2-5 minutes).

				<tr >
					<td width="30%" >
						<h4  style="color:brown;">Slow Cooking</h3>
						<p>People turned their backs on slow cooking their food for a while because of the fear that cooking foods too long means 
						the nutrients go out the window. And that's really true, for the most part.....<br />
						You can also cook beans all by their lonesome in a slow cooker because
						when your beans are done cooking there is always "broth" leftover.

					<td width="30">
						<h4  style="color:brown;">Roasting/Baking</h3>
						<p>Cooking anything in the high heat of the oven is going to provide a "seal"
						on the outside of your food so the inside can cook 
						but remain fairly moist even as the outside gets crispy and crunchy.
